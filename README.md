# ALX
Welcome to ALX Shell basics ALX project where I interract with all the shell projects.
Each file in this directory is an executable shell script that is meant to perform one action or another.

---
> The actions they perform can be inferred from their names
> For instance, the one with the prefix 0- prints the current working directory.
